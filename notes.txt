All solidity code gets compiled to EVM (ethereum virtual machine)
examples -- Avalance, Fantom, Polygon are EVM compatible

While creating a contract steps:
1) Write the SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
2) Write the version of solidity you want to use
3) contract is similar to a class in other programming languages
4) Arrays,struct, mapping(dictionary),functions, view and pure functions
5) calldata and memory (temporary), storage variables
